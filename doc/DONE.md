# Done

Progress log against [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Each milestone records what landed, deviations from the plan, and open gaps. Update at the end of every milestone.

## Phase 1 — TypeScript + Vite + Vitest

### M1 — Tooling bootstrap — ✅ done (with one intentional deviation)

Landed:
- [package.json](../package.json) with `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `format` scripts.
- Runtime deps via npm: `dompurify`, `html-to-image` (replacing the vendored copies under [lib/](../lib/)).
- Dev deps: `typescript`, `vite`, `vitest`, `jsdom`, `@types/node`, `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `prettier`.
- [tsconfig.json](../tsconfig.json) with `strict: true` plus `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `isolatedModules`, `resolveJsonModule`.
- [vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts) — minimal, `publicDir: 'public'`, Vitest with jsdom.
- [eslint.config.js](../eslint.config.js) and [.prettierrc](../.prettierrc) present.
- [public/conf/](../public/conf/) and [public/models/](../public/models/) in place so Vite serves them at the same URLs as before.

Deviation:
- **Vite `base` is `'/'`, not `'/canvas/'`.** Plan called for `/canvas/` to match the parent-site deploy path. Defensible now that the repo is split and publishes via a release script — the canvas app will live at the root of its own dev server, then get copied into the parent site's `/canvas/` directory at release time. Decision is only consistent once M2's `scripts/release.sh` exists and rewrites asset paths (or the release flow accepts this). **Revisit when M2 release dry-run happens** — if built paths break against `unlost.ventures/canvas/`, flip `base` back to `/canvas/`.

Gaps: none blocking.

---

### M2 — Repo split & standalone layout — ✅ done (two items intentionally deferred)

Landed:
- **Repo split with history preserved.** Commit `a576792` ("adjust for split out of canvas repo subtree"); `git log` shows the pre-split canvas commits.
- **`canvas.html` → `index.html`** as Vite's default entry.
- **M1 workarounds removed.** [vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts) has no `stripParentAssets` plugin, no `server.fs.allow`, no `build.rollupOptions.input` override.
- **Dead / vendored files deleted:** `network.js`, `lib/` (`purify.es.js`, `html-to-image.es.min.js`, plus stray `jspdf.es.min.js`, `html-to-image.min.js`, `purfy.min.js` typo, `lib/index.html`), `canvas_test.html`.
- **Dead `useServer` / `FileUploader` branch removed from [main.js](../main.js)** (the only caller of network.js; sat inside `if (useServer)`, which was always false given every shipped config has `canvasd.mode: "off"`).
- **[scripts/release.sh](../scripts/release.sh) created** per [ARCH.md#release-script](ARCH.md#release-script): preflight checks (clean tree, target exists, target is a git repo), `npm run build`, clear target `canvas/` contents (with `--force` to skip the confirm), copy `dist/.` (dotfile-safe), write `canvas/VERSION` with commit hash + UTC timestamp. Does **not** commit or push on the target — maintainer-reviewable.
- **Lint baseline green.** [eslint.config.js](../eslint.config.js) drops stale `lib/**` and `network.js` ignores; `npx eslint .` passes, `npx tsc --noEmit` passes, `node --check main.js` passes, `bash -n scripts/release.sh` passes.

Deferred by user decision (not blockers):
- **Parent-site chrome retained in [index.html](../index.html).** Plan called for stripping `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `aurora` container, etc. Kept because the references are absolute URLs to `unlost.ventures` and local assets under [global/](../global/) — they don't break when the page serves standalone. Revisit if the standalone-page story ever needs to look chromeless.
- **[global/](../global/) retained.** Follows from the chrome decision above — it's what the surviving chrome imports.
- **Release dry-run not yet executed.** `scripts/release.sh` is wired and smoke-tested for CLI surface (usage message, uncommitted-tree guard, unknown-flag rejection, `--help`) but has not been run end-to-end against `../unlost.ventures`. The `base: '/'` vs `'/canvas/'` question stays parked until that run happens.

Insights:
- The `useServer` code path was dead for a separate reason I didn't spot until digging in: [index.html](../index.html) never loaded `network.js` as a `<script>` at all — the only `<script type="module">` is `./main.js`. So `new FileUploader(...)` would have thrown `ReferenceError` at runtime if `useServer` had ever been true. Removing the branch fixes lint (no more undefined `FileUploader`) and removes a runtime footgun the plan had already flagged for deletion.
- `cp -R dist/. target/` (note the trailing `/.`) copies dotfiles; `cp -R dist/* target/` doesn't. Not relevant for Vite output today, but worth pinning the idiom.
- `find <dir> -mindepth 1 -delete` is the cleanest way to empty a directory in the release script — handles dotfiles, doesn't need shell globbing, doesn't accidentally delete the directory itself.

Gaps (follow-up):
- Release dry-run against `../unlost.ventures`: `scripts/release.sh ../unlost.ventures`. After that, decide Vite `base`.
- Update [README.md](../README.md) once the dry-run lands — Project Layout still lists `network.js`/`lib/`, and Running Locally still tells users to `python3 -m http.server` from the parent.

### M3 — Type definitions — ✅ done

Landed:
- [src/types/canvas.ts](../src/types/canvas.ts) — `CardType`, `Card`, `Cell`, `Meta`, `Analysis`, `CanvasState`.
- [src/types/config.ts](../src/types/config.ts) — `YesNo`, `Settings` (with `CanvasdSettings`, `LocalStorageSettings`, `LayoutSettings`), `ConfigMeta`, `CellStructure`, `ScoringRule`, `CanvasConfig`, `CanvasTypeRef`, `CanvasTypesList`.
- [src/types/_validate.ts](../src/types/_validate.ts) — compile-check samples transcribed from [public/conf/preseed.json](../public/conf/preseed.json), [public/models/example.json](../public/models/example.json), [public/conf/configs.json](../public/conf/configs.json); typed via left-hand annotations so string literals narrow to `YesNo` / `CardType`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.

Deviations from the plan:
- **Two `Meta` shapes, not one.** The plan's `Meta` conflated two structurally different things. Config's top-level `meta` is `{ type, version, date, canvas, template, description }` ([preseed.json](../public/conf/preseed.json)); a saved canvas's `meta` is `{ title, description, canvas, version, date }` ([example.json](../public/models/example.json)). Split into `ConfigMeta` (config.ts) and `Meta` (canvas.ts).
- **`CanvasState.canvas` is `Cell[]`, not `{ cells: Cell[] }`.** [ARCH.md](ARCH.md#state-model) sketches the store as `{ cells }`, but the current localStorage JSON ([canvas.js:62](../canvas.js#L62) `Canvas.toJSON()` returns `this.cells` bare) serializes a flat array. 1:1 equivalence wins; the Zustand store in phase 2 can wrap this without changing the on-disk format.
- **Didn't import JSON directly for the compile check.** With `resolveJsonModule`, JSON string fields widen to `string`, so `score: "yes"` fails `YesNo = 'yes' | 'no'`. Used typed literal fixtures in `_validate.ts` with left-hand type annotations — TS narrows correctly that way. Real JSON validation will happen at runtime in M4's `io.ts` (Zod or a hand-rolled guard).
- **`canvasd.mode`, `localstorage.mode`, `canvasclass` kept as `string`, not unions.** Configs only exhibit `'off'` / `'manual'` today, but [main.js](../main.js) doesn't constrain them. Locking them down would be premature and brittle.

Insights:
- `CardType` is `'query' | 'comment' | 'analysis' | 'emphasis'` per [canvas.js:269](../canvas.js#L269); the `:- ` command explicitly clears to `undefined` (base card), so `type` is optional, not a "default" value.
- Scoring rule's `scores` is `Record<string, string>` — keys are user-defined sub-score names (`Product`, `Market`, …) referenced by `total` via `evaluateFormula`.

Gaps: none. Ready for M4.

### M4 — Port util.js → src/util/*.ts — ✅ done

Landed — nine typed modules, one re-export shim:
- [src/util/dom.ts](../src/util/dom.ts) — `createElement`, `toggleElements`.
- [src/util/sanitize.ts](../src/util/sanitize.ts) — `sanitize`, `sanitizeJSON`, `convertBR`, `convertNL`, `decodeHtml`, `encodeHtml`, `trimPluralS`.
- [src/util/log.ts](../src/util/log.ts) — `lg` + module-level `_debugEnabled` / `isDebugEnabled`.
- [src/util/longpress.ts](../src/util/longpress.ts) — `addLongPressListener`, `generateLongPressEvents` (500 ms default, 10 px move-cancel threshold preserved).
- [src/util/editable.ts](../src/util/editable.ts) — `makeEditable` (Enter inserts two `<br>` via Selection/Range, same as original).
- [src/util/dragdrop.ts](../src/util/dragdrop.ts) — `makeDraggable`, `makeDroppable`; module-level `highlightClass` / `dragClass` constants; imports `generateLongPressEvents` from longpress.ts.
- [src/util/overlay.ts](../src/util/overlay.ts) — `overlayMenu`, `confirmStep`, `showToast`; imports `createElement` from dom.ts.
- [src/util/svg.ts](../src/util/svg.ts) — `convertDivToSvg`; imports `htmlToImage` from the npm package.
- [src/util/io.ts](../src/util/io.ts) — `loadJson`, `downloadLs`, `uploadLs`; imports `sanitizeJSON` (sanitize.ts) and `showToast` (overlay.ts).
- [util.js](../util.js) — slimmed from 388 lines to ~22: re-exports every name from the nine TS modules so [main.js](../main.js) and [canvas.js](../canvas.js) keep their `import … from './util.js'` lines unchanged until M5/M6.

Verification:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npx eslint .` clean.
- `node --check util.js` clean.
- `npm run build` succeeds — 30 modules transformed, single 55.78 kB JS chunk (gzipped 19.72 kB) covering the full graph (main.js → canvas.js / util.js shim → TS modules → dompurify / html-to-image).

Deviations from the plan (intentional, 1:1 behavior preserved):
- **Shim [util.js](../util.js) instead of deleting it.** The plan's layout has `util.js` gone once ports land, but [main.js](../main.js) and [canvas.js](../canvas.js) still run as `.js` files and import from `./util.js` by literal path. Replacing the implementation with a thin re-export preserves their import lines untouched — removes a two-file refactor that doesn't belong in M4. Shim deletes in M6 when [main.js](../main.js) ports to TS.
- **Import paths use explicit `.ts` extension from the shim** (`from './src/util/dom.ts'`). Vite resolves this natively; it makes the fan-out self-documenting and survives tools that don't auto-resolve extensions.

Insights:
- **Non-null assertions everywhere the original JS assumed non-null.** `tsconfig.strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` flag dozens of "this could be undefined" sites that the original JS implicitly trusted (`stackLines[2]`, `touches[0]`, `elem.parentNode`, `dataUrl.split(',')[1]`). Used `!` rather than adding fallbacks — matches original runtime behavior 1:1, including its edge-case failures. Adding defensive `?? ''` fallbacks would silently change behavior.
- **`confirmStep`'s monkey-patched element state** (`elem.originalText`, `elem.confirming`, `elem.confirmTimeout`) is typed via a `ConfirmableElement extends HTMLElement` interface and a cast at function entry. Clean and keeps the original "patch state directly onto the DOM node" pattern — worth revising in phase 2 but out of scope here.
- **Zero-width space in `convertBR` regex.** Kept; had to be written as `​` in source (the literal character triggers `no-irregular-whitespace`). Functionally identical regex.
- **ESLint flat-config `ignores` list entry for `util.js` still applies** — the shim is brief enough that linting it would add value, but its import specifiers carry explicit `.ts` extensions which the JS parser dislikes if treated as resolvable. Easier to keep it ignored until it's deleted in M6.

Gaps: none. Ready for M5.

---

### M5 — Port canvas.js → src/canvas/*.ts + src/scoring/formula.ts — ✅ done

Landed:
- [src/canvas/Canvas.ts](../src/canvas/Canvas.ts), [Cell.ts](../src/canvas/Cell.ts), [Card.ts](../src/canvas/Card.ts), [PreCanvas.ts](../src/canvas/PreCanvas.ts), [PostCanvas.ts](../src/canvas/PostCanvas.ts) — one file per class, types wired to [src/types/canvas.ts](../src/types/canvas.ts) and [src/types/config.ts](../src/types/config.ts).
- [src/canvas/dragState.ts](../src/canvas/dragState.ts) — module-level `dragState` object + `resetDragState()` replacing the six `static` fields on Cell / Card (`Cell.dragSource/dragDest`, `Card.dragSource/dragDest/dragSourceIndex/dragDestIndex`). `Card.count` stays as a static because [main.js:75](../main.js#L75) still writes it directly — plan only targeted the drag statics.
- [src/scoring/formula.ts](../src/scoring/formula.ts) — `evaluateFormula` extracted from PostCanvas; signature unchanged (`(formula, context) => number`), still reads `score(n)` live from DOM.
- [test/formula.test.ts](../test/formula.test.ts) — 12 Vitest specs covering parser basics (numbers, precedence, parens), context lookup, DOM `score()` integration (with jsdom-backed `<select>` elements), and a preseed-style weighted total from [public/conf/preseed.json](../public/conf/preseed.json). All passing.
- [main.d.ts](../main.d.ts) — type shim for [main.js](../main.js) so canvas TS modules can `import { app, conf } from '../../main'` without enabling `allowJs`. Declares `app`/`conf`/`ctl` as `any` (file-level `eslint-disable` for `no-explicit-any`). Deletes in M6.
- [tsconfig.json](../tsconfig.json) — `main.d.ts` added to `include`.
- [canvas.js](../canvas.js) — slimmed from 458 lines to ~12: re-export shim forwarding `Canvas` / `Cell` / `Card` / `PreCanvas` / `PostCanvas` from the TS modules. Same pattern as M4's `util.js`. Keeps [main.js](../main.js)'s `import … from './canvas.js'` line unchanged until M6.

Verification:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npx eslint .` clean.
- `npx vitest run` → 12/12 specs in [test/formula.test.ts](../test/formula.test.ts) pass.
- `npm run build` succeeds — 37 modules transformed (up from 30 in M4), single 56.01 kB JS chunk (gzipped 19.90 kB).

Deviations / decisions:
- **`Cell.score` typed as `string | number | undefined`, not `number`.** The legacy runtime actually stores both: initial load assigns a number (from JSON), but the dropdown `change` handler assigns the raw `<select>.value` string. Serialization and DOM reads accept either. Tightening this is phase 2 territory — 1:1 demands keeping the mixed type.
- **`DragState.sourceCell` / `destCell` typed as `string | number | undefined`.** Same reason: `Cell.render`'s `makeDroppable` callback sets the destination to a number (`this.index`), but `Card.render`'s drag callbacks set it to a string (from `getAttribute('data-index')`). The strict `===` in `Canvas.updateDragDrop` depends on this: a card-drop-onto-empty-cell-area always takes the "cross-cell" branch because `"2" === 2` is false — arguably a bug, preserved 1:1.
- **main.d.ts + main.js over a context module.** Plan §M6 flags the circular `main ↔ canvas` import for later cleanup. Writing a context-passing refactor in M5 would mean touching [main.js](../main.js) (M6 work) — out of scope. The `.d.ts` shim gives TS enough type info to compile; Vite resolves the real module at runtime, and the circular structure is inherited unchanged from the pre-migration code.
- **`as unknown as {...}` in the dead `Card.getCellCardPos` static.** The legacy code calls `.cellIndex()` / `.cardCellPos()` on a raw `HTMLElement`, which have no such methods — broken at runtime, but unused anywhere in the app. Kept 1:1 with a cast rather than deleted.

Insights:
- **ES-module live bindings carry the circular import across the port.** [main.js](../main.js) does `let app = undefined` at module-load, then populates after `DOMContentLoaded`. TS modules under [src/canvas/](../src/canvas/) import `app` eagerly but only *read* it inside instance methods (called post-bootstrap). Same lazy access pattern as pre-migration — no changes needed to the runtime structure.
- **`Card.count` readable/writable from main.js.** Keeping it as a TS `static count = 0` preserves the `Card.count = 0` reset-before-Application.create pattern. TS doesn't prevent external writes to non-`readonly` statics — matches JS semantics exactly. Once main.js ports in M6, this can become `private` and expose a `reset()` helper.
- **Formula evaluator's DOM coupling limits testing.** `score(n)` reads `document.getElementById('score${n}')` inside `parseFactor`. jsdom makes this tractable for unit tests (add fake `<select>` elements), but phase 2 should consider passing a `scoreLookup: (n) => number` function to `evaluateFormula` — decouples parser from DOM and simplifies React integration.

Gaps: none. Ready for M6.

---

### M6 — Port main.js → src/main.ts + break the circular import — ✅ done

Landed:
- [src/main.ts](../src/main.ts) — typed `Application` / `Settings` / `Controls`, DOMContentLoaded bootstrap, `beforeunload` auto-save, Ctrl+S/Cmd+S keydown handler. 1:1 with the legacy main.js; behavior preserved including the silent `catch` on save errors, the `conf || new Settings(...)` short-circuit in `Settings.create`, and the ignored param on `newApp.render(defaultConfigName)` (dropped — it was already ignored in the original).
- [src/context.ts](../src/context.ts) — runtime context module. Uses `export let app` + `setApp()` pattern so importers under [src/canvas/](../src/canvas/) get live-binding semantics identical to the pre-migration `export { app } from './main.js'`. Types are intentionally loose (`any`) — typing them would reintroduce the import cycle; phase 2 replaces this with a React context or zustand store. File-level eslint-disable for `no-explicit-any`.
- All five [src/canvas/](../src/canvas/) modules switched from `import { app } from '../../main'` → `import { app } from '../context'`. [PreCanvas.ts](../src/canvas/PreCanvas.ts) tightened: `canvas` field from `unknown` to `string` (it was always a canvas-type identifier string in practice), and the `PreCanvasCtorData` legacy union collapsed to plain `Meta`.
- [src/canvas/Cell.ts](../src/canvas/Cell.ts) constructor's content parameter replaced `Partial<CellData> | readonly never[]` with a dedicated `CellContent` interface that accepts plain JSON, a `Cell` instance (what `restructure` passes), or `[]`. Needed because `Cell.score` uses the wider `Score = string | number | undefined` (runtime mixed-typing) while `CellData.score` is `number | undefined`.
- [index.html](../index.html) loads `./src/main.ts` as the module entry (Vite handles the TS transpilation transparently).

Deleted:
- `main.js`, `util.js` (M4 shim), `canvas.js` (M5 shim), `main.d.ts` (M5 type shim). Plus stale eslint ignores (`main.js`, `canvas.js`, `util.js`) and the tsconfig `main.d.ts` include entry.

Verification:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npx eslint .` clean.
- `npx vitest run` → 12/12 passing (formula.test.ts unaffected).
- `npm run build` succeeds — 36 modules transformed (37 → 36: the two re-export shims collapsed away), single 56.23 kB JS chunk (gzipped 20.01 kB).
- Zero `.js` files remaining in app source (app root has only config files: [eslint.config.js](../eslint.config.js), [vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts), [scripts/release.sh](../scripts/release.sh)).

Decisions / deviations:
- **Context module over constructor injection.** Plan allowed either: "pass `app`/`conf` through constructors or a small context module." Constructor injection would have required wiring `app` through every Cell / Card / PreCanvas / PostCanvas method via `this.app` — dozens of edits across five classes, all mechanical, all churn. Context module is one import-path change per canvas file (`'../../main'` → `'../context'`) and keeps the rest of the call sites untouched. Phase 2's React refactor replaces this anyway.
- **`export let` + live bindings instead of getter functions.** The alternative `export function getApp()` would force every call site in canvas files to change (`app.X` → `getApp().X`). `export let app` + `setApp()` preserves the existing call-site syntax exactly, with identical live-binding semantics to what JS modules already provide. Read-only on the import side; writable only via the explicit setter.
- **`any` types in [context.ts](../src/context.ts).** Typing `app` as `Application` would require importing it from main.ts → canvas/*.ts → context.ts → main.ts (cycle). Structural interfaces (`AppLike`) would drag Canvas / PreCanvas / PostCanvas types into the context module — same cycle, one level removed. `any` is the honest escape hatch for an intermediate build step. Phase 2 removes the need entirely.
- **Signature changes from the 1:1 rule (minor):** `Application.render()` dropped the unused `defaultConfigName` arg; `uploadLs()` method on Application was never called (only `Application.downloadLs()` has a matching [Controls](../src/main.ts) button, and even that uses the util helper, not an Application method) — removed. Both are dead-code cleanups that don't alter observable behavior.

Insights:
- **Circular import wasn't actually a runtime problem pre-migration.** [main.js](../main.js) declared `let app = undefined` at load and reassigned after `DOMContentLoaded`; canvas classes imported `app` eagerly but only *read* it inside instance methods that ran post-bootstrap. The cycle was cosmetic — it confused TS's strict analysis more than it confused the runtime. The new `setApp()` pattern makes the timing explicit: bootstrap calls `setApp(newApp)` exactly once after construction completes, and every read thereafter resolves via live binding.
- **`export let` is ES-module-legal and widely underused.** TypeScript's strictness often nudges people toward `export const { app: any }` object patterns, but `export let` with setters is structurally cleaner for small contexts like this. Worth remembering.
- **Re-export shims were a cheap port scaffold.** M4's [util.js](../util.js) and M5's [canvas.js](../canvas.js) shims bought uninterrupted runtime compat across three milestones while the underlying modules were being typed piece by piece. At M6 they vanish without ceremony. Pattern worth repeating any time a large module tree is being typed incrementally.
- **Vite does TS-entry modules natively.** `<script type="module" src="./src/main.ts">` works in dev and build — no loader config needed. A subtle "TS-ifying existed all along" moment that's easy to miss coming from older build toolchains.

Gaps: none. **Phase 1 M6 done — every `.js` source is now `.ts`, the app runs through a single typed entry.**

---

### M7 — Port Jasmine specs → Vitest + jsdom — ✅ done

Landed:
- **main.ts split into app.ts + main.ts.** [src/app.ts](../src/app.ts) holds the `Settings` / `Application` / `Controls` classes (side-effect-free, exported). [src/main.ts](../src/main.ts) is now a ~55-line bootstrap that just wires up DOMContentLoaded, beforeunload, and Ctrl+S. Tests import the classes directly without the bootstrap firing.
- [test/helpers.ts](../test/helpers.ts) — fixture loading (`loadFixture`), fetch mock (`installFetchMock` — serves files from `public/` based on the requested path), Application bootstrap (`bootstrapApp` — resets DOM + localStorage, loads fixtures, creates `Settings` + `Application`, writes them to context), and a `flush()` microtask-drain helper for async paths.
- [test/load.test.ts](../test/load.test.ts) — ports `LoadSpec`: initial-state assertion (title, cells[4].cards[1]) and save → clear → load round-trip.
- [test/card.test.ts](../test/card.test.ts) — ports `CardSpec`: edit, remove, add, and the `:?` type-command card-class assertion.
- [test/interact.test.ts](../test/interact.test.ts) — ports `InteractSpec`: help-overlay dblclick toggle and score-change → total-update propagation.
- **Jasmine artifacts deleted:** [test/CardSpec.js](../test/CardSpec.js), [test/InteractSpec.js](../test/InteractSpec.js), [test/LoadSpec.js](../test/LoadSpec.js), [test/lib/](../test/lib/) (vendored Jasmine 5.1.2). Stale `test/**/*.js` entry removed from [eslint.config.js](../eslint.config.js) ignores.
- **File rename:** `src/canvas/dragState.ts` → [src/canvas/DragState.ts](../src/canvas/DragState.ts) for casing consistency with the other files in [src/canvas/](../src/canvas/) (Canvas, Cell, Card, PreCanvas, PostCanvas). Imports in Canvas.ts / Card.ts / Cell.ts updated.

Verification:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npx eslint .` clean.
- `npx vitest run` → **20/20 passing** (12 formula + 2 load + 4 card + 2 interact).
- `npm run build` succeeds — 37 modules transformed, 56.26 kB bundle (20.02 kB gzipped).

Deviations / decisions:
- **`main.ts` split into `app.ts` + `main.ts`** (not in the plan, but forced by testability). Importing main.ts registers a DOMContentLoaded listener that fetches model/config JSON over the network; at test-time that fails and pollutes with console.error. Splitting separates the classes from the bootstrap cleanly. Bonus: `main.ts` is now a 55-line entry point that's trivial to reason about. Phase 2 React refactor lands classes in components anyway.
- **Interact score test rewritten, not literally ported.** The original [test/InteractSpec.js](../test/InteractSpec.js) checked `helpElem.getAttribute('display')` — which always returns `null` (`display` is a CSS property, not an HTML attribute), so the original assertion was a tautology that never failed. Ported to check `helpElem.style.display` — the property the app actually sets. Applied to the original Jasmine runner, the new assertion would have exposed the bug; applied to our Vitest port, it passes.
- **LoadSpec round-trip needed an explicit title in `loadFromLs`.** `app.clear()` resets `meta.title` to `'Company name'`, so the no-arg `app.loadFromLs()` call in the original Jasmine spec couldn't have found the saved `'Example Startup'` record — the test was aspirational. Ported test passes `'Example Startup'` explicitly, matching the obvious intent.
- **Map-backed `localStorage` polyfill in tests.** Node 22's experimental `localStorage` leaks into the vitest+jsdom environment as a plain object without `getItem` / `setItem` / `removeItem` / `clear` methods. [test/helpers.ts](../test/helpers.ts) installs a small Map-backed stub via `Object.defineProperty(globalThis, 'localStorage', …)` before bootstrap. Scoped to the test helper — zero impact on the real app which uses browser-native localStorage.
- **Fetch mock keys off the URL path.** The app calls `fetch('conf/foo.json')`; under jsdom those URLs are relative to `document.URL` (about:blank or similar). The mock regex-matches the `(conf|models)/...` tail of whatever URL arrives and reads from the matching `public/` file. Robust to jsdom's base-URL behavior.
- **`dragState.ts` → `DragState.ts`** for filename casing consistency — requested inline while M7 was in progress. Import sites updated via sed.

Insights:
- **The original Jasmine tests depended on a full-browser harness** (the deleted `canvas_test.html` loaded the app and then Jasmine over it). Vitest + jsdom gives the same reach without a browser, but the harness-gone means *we* bootstrap the app in each test — which surfaces a clear line between "app setup" (helpers.ts) and "assertions" (the spec bodies). Cleaner than the Jasmine setup, which relied on global `app` / `ctl` / `Card` from the test runner.
- **Two real bugs discovered in the original specs.** The overlay test used the wrong API (`getAttribute('display')`), and the save-load round-trip assumed a title resolution that `clear()` invalidates. Both are latent bugs in the *tests*, not the app — but the Vitest port surfaces them because strict comparisons fail loudly where silent null/undefined in the original passed by accident.
- **`Application.loadFromLs` is fire-and-forget.** It kicks off a `fetch().then(...)` chain but returns `void`. Tests work around this with a small `flush()` (20ms setTimeout) — enough for microtasks and the mocked fetch to drain. A phase-2 refactor should promisify this; the callers in Controls are all `.bind(app)` callbacks that don't need a return value, so the refactor is cheap.
- **`Object.defineProperty(globalThis, 'localStorage', …)`** is the right pattern for jsdom-quirk workarounds. Direct assignment silently fails because `globalThis.localStorage` has an unwritable descriptor in some Node / jsdom combos. `defineProperty` with `writable: true, configurable: true` overrides cleanly.

Gaps: none. Phase 1 tests green; ready for M8 release verification.

### M8 — Release verification — ◯ partially done (docs updated; two blockers for dry-run)

Landed:
- [README.md](../README.md) fully rewritten. Stale refs (`main.js`, `util.js`, `canvas.js`, `network.js`, `lib/`, `canvas_test.html`, `python3 -m http.server`, migration note) gone. New structure: Getting started, Project layout (TS tree), URL parameters, Interaction model, Controls, Data format, Testing, Release / deployment, Notes. Points at [doc/ARCH.md#deployment](ARCH.md) for release details.
- [ARCH.md](ARCH.md) reviewed — no stale references; document was written to target-state so the finished phase-1 port already matches. Release-script section already specifies the exact behavior implemented in [scripts/release.sh](../scripts/release.sh).
- Automated verification run: `tsc`, `eslint`, `vitest` (20/20), `vite build` all clean against HEAD.

**Asset / deploy decisions** (resolved after the docs rewrite):

1. **`base: '/'` kept in [vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts).** User's call: the canvas deploys at the *root* of its own target (whether that's a standalone subdomain, `/canvas/` mounted via reverse-proxy rewrite, or the root of the `canvas/` dir copied into the parent site — all three resolve `/assets/index-*.js` correctly because the canvas is served at `/`). This inverts the M1 deviation's eventual resolution — turns out `/canvas/` was never the right `base`; the canvas just needs to be served *at* its own root.

2. **`global/` moved into [public/global/](../public/global/) and fonts into [public/fonts/](../public/fonts/).** User's call (from option (b) of the previously-open list). The chrome is now a first-class part of the canvas deploy, no dependency on anything the parent site serves. Absolute paths everywhere:
   - `global/{aurora.css, aurora.js, script.js, styles.css, unlost.svg}` → [public/global/](../public/global/)
   - `global/fonts/Montserrat/` → [public/fonts/Montserrat/](../public/fonts/)
   - [public/global/styles.css](../public/global/styles.css) `@font-face` url updated from `/global/fonts/…` to `/fonts/…` via `sed`.
   - [index.html](../index.html) refs changed from relative `global/*` to absolute `/global/*` (so Vite leaves them alone as public-served assets instead of trying to bundle them and failing because the old path doesn't exist).
   - [.gitignore](../.gitignore) adds `.DS_Store` so macOS metadata doesn't leak into `dist/`.

Served layout in `dist/`:

| Asset | Path | How |
|---|---|---|
| App JS + canvas/layout CSS | `/assets/index-*.{js,css}` | bundled by Vite |
| Chrome styles | `/global/{styles,aurora}.css` | public-served |
| Chrome scripts | `/global/{script,aurora}.js` | public-served |
| Logo | `/global/unlost.svg` | public-served |
| Fonts | `/fonts/Montserrat-*.ttf` | public-served, referenced by `/global/styles.css` `@font-face` |
| Canvas configs | `/conf/*.json` | public-served |
| Canvas models | `/models/*.json` | public-served |

Build is now warning-free (the previous `can't be bundled without type='module'` warnings for the chrome scripts are gone because Vite treats absolute paths as public-served, not bundle candidates). Bundle numbers: HTML 7.01 kB (was 12.63 kB — dropped the inline SVG for the logo, it's now served as a file), CSS 9.35 kB (was 12.87 kB — chrome CSS served separately, not in the app bundle), JS 56.26 kB unchanged.

**Manual steps remaining** (require a browser + the parent-site checkout — can't automate):

- Run `scripts/release.sh ../unlost.ventures` (or the actual parent-site path). Confirm: build succeeds, `canvas/` cleared, `dist/` copied, `canvas/VERSION` written with the right commit hash.
- Walk the phase 1–2 equivalence checklist from [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) against the deployed URL: load every config in [public/conf/](../public/conf/), drag cards (desktop + touch long-press), save/load via LS controls, export SVG, round-trip a pre-migration saved canvas if one exists, verify the `?model=...&config=...&debug=...` URL params behave.

Gaps: just the dry-run + manual walkthrough.
